# Military Ranks Quiz Game #
## Summary ##
A small webpage that uses Javascript to continuously quiz the player on various enlisted Marines and Air Force rankings. The game, once started, shows a military insignia, and the player is prompted to chose one of four rankings, one of which is the correct accompanying title for the insignia.
The player is told whether their answer is correct, and then they are prompted to continue. The game continues as long as the player wishes, regardless of how many wrong answers are submitted. 

## Future Updates ##
The functionality of the website will likely remain mostly unchanged, future updates will simply add more rankings to the game. Currently, only Marine and Air Force enlisted positions are displayed, so there is potential for future updates to add other branches and expanding to officer positions as well.
